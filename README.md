# Matplotlib-Challenge


I have completed this assignment up until the bar graphs. I am having some trouble with other sections, but will continue working on them and resubmit at a later time. 
Also, I asked for help on how to git push the jupyter notebook file and was briefly told how to do it. However, when I tried to do it, I ran into an error and so for now have added a Word document with screenshots of my code. I will get help on this issue as soon as possible and submit it properly at a later time.
